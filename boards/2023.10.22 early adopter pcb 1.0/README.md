# PSPi 6: 2023.10.22 Production Board Notes and Fixes

## Ordering Notes
- This PCB is on order, but UNTESTED! I recommend waiting until I receive a set before ordering them yourself.
- The PSPi 6 mainboard needs double-sided assembly, which is pricey. The CM4 carrier also needs both sides be placed, but it is not too difficult to solder the GPIO header, SD card, and switch if you want to save some money. The headphone board only needs single sided assembly.

## Components to be Placed Manually

Some components are not available for automatic placement and must be placed manually. Below is the list of these components with links to purchase them:
