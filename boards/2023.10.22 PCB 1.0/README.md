# PSPi 6: 2023.10.22 Production Board Notes and Fixes

## Ordering Notes
- This PCB is on order, but UNTESTED! I recommend waiting until I receive a set before ordering them yourself.
- The PSPi 6 mainboard needs double-sided assembly, which is pricey. The CM4 carrier also needs both sides be placed, but it is not too difficult to solder the GPIO header, SD card, and switch if you want to save some money. The headphone board only needs single sided assembly.
