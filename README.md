# PSPi 6: Raspberry Pi in a PSP

![PSPi](https://othermod.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_8727.jpg)

This is my passion project that transforms the classic PSP 1000 into a modern handheld using a Raspberry Pi. This page documents the combination of hardware and software development.

## üéÆ What is PSPi 6?

PSPi 6 is a custom circuit board that replaces the mainboard of a PSP 1000, allowing you to use a Raspberry Pi as its brain. This means you can:

- Play retro games and emulators
- Run full Linux distributions and use it as a portable computer
- Use most software that works on a Raspberry Pi

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Display**: High quality [800x480 LCD](https://othermod.com/product/4-3-800x480-lcd/) with adjustable brightness
- **Power Management**: Efficient charging, real-time battery monitoring, and power-saving modes
- **Audio**: Play audio through the PSP speakers or headphones
  - Control volume and mute using the PSP buttons
  - *Note: The Pi Zero and CM4 Carrier give mono audio. The Universal Carrier is planned to output stereo*
- **Controls**: All original PSP buttons and joystick are used
  - The board allows for two extra buttons and an extra joystick
- **Indicators**: LED indicators and on-screen display for system status
- **Open Design**: Customizable open-source hardware under Creative Commons license

## üß© Compatibility

- **PSP Model**: Works exclusively with PSP 1000 series. Visit the [PSP Compatibility Wiki Page](https://github.com/othermod/PSPi-Version-6/wiki/2.-PSP-Compatibility) page for more details
- **Raspberry Pi**:
  - Fits Raspberry Pi Zero, Zero 2W, and CM4 (with CM4 Carrier board)
  - Electrically compatible with all 40-pin Raspberry Pis, but only the Zero/Zero 2 fit into the shell
  - The [Raspberry Pi Compatibility Wiki Page](https://github.com/othermod/PSPi-Version-6/wiki/3.-Raspberry-Pi-Compatibility) will help you decide which Raspberry Pi model you want to use.
- **Operating Systems**: RetroPie, Lakka, Ubuntu, Raspberry Pi OS, Batocera, Kali, and more!

## üöÄ Getting Started

- **Gather Components**: Check the [Components Required Wiki Page](https://github.com/othermod/PSPi-Version-6/wiki/4.-Components-Required) for a full list.
- **Assembly**: Follow the guides on the [Board Installation Wiki](https://github.com/othermod/PSPi-Version-6/wiki/5.-Board-Installation). Video tutorials are available, and a full guide is in the works.
- **Software Setup**: Use the [Operating Systems Wiki Page](https://github.com/othermod/PSPi-Version-6/wiki/6.-Operating-Systems) to install your chosen OS.

## üõí How to Get a PSPi 6

1. **Buy a Ready-Made Board**: Available now at [othermod.com](https://othermod.com/product/pspi-6-board/). Perfect for those who want more of a plug-and-play experience.

2. **Make Your Own**: You can use the provided PCB files to manufacture your own board:
   - Download the design files from the [boards folder](https://github.com/othermod/PSPi-Version-6/tree/main/boards).
   - Send the files to a PCB manufacturer of your choice. I use [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/?from=othermod) for every board I sell.
   - Source the components and assemble the board yourself.

   Note: This option requires advanced skills in electronics and soldering.

## üöß Project Status

PSPi 6 board development is complete and boards are shipping. I do sometimes make minor changes to the board, but nothing that affects the important features. I'm continually improving documentation and working on guides to help users get the most out of their PSPi 6.
